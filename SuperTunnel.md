SuperTunnel is a program that tunnels normal TCP traffic over HTTP. I primarily designed it to get around the firewall at my dad's work when I go to work with him. The firewall blocks everything except HTTP and HTTPS, so I wrote SuperTunnel so that I can connect to my server via ssh by tunneling the ssh connection through SuperTunnel.

I'll get more information up here soon on how to use SuperTunnel. If you're anxious, use an IRC client (do a google search for that if you don't know what it is) to connect to irc.freenode.net, join channel #bztraining, and ask jcp for help. Or send an email to the project owners of the jwutils project (which can be seen on the JWUtils home page, http://jwutils.googlecode.com).

**SuperTunnel is now part of its own project, located [here](http://supertunnel.googlecode.com).**
