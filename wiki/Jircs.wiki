Jircs is a pure-java IRC server I've been working on just for the heck of it. Go to jwutils's source, and browse to trunk/projects/jircs/src/jw/jircs/Connection.java to get the latest version. Yes, it's contained within a single java file, and yes, I know that's not good practice. The idea is that if you want to run it, you download it, "javac Connection.java", and then "java jw.jircs.Connection".
